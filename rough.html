                <h1> Que.1 Stack Data Structure (Introduction and Program)
                </h1> <br>
                <h1>Explanation</h1>
                <pre style="font-size: 20px;">
        Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the 
        operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO
        (First In Last Out). This strategy states that the element that is inserted 
        last will come out first. You can take a pile of plates kept on top of each 
        other as a real-life example. The plate which we put last is on the top and 
        since we remove the plate that is at the top, we can say that the plate that 
        was put last comes out first. Some of its main operations are: push(), pop(), 
        top(), isEmpty(), size(), etc.  In order to make manipulations in a stack,
        there are certain operations 
        provided to us. When we want to insert an element into the stack the operation 
        is known as the push operation whereas when we want to remove an element from 
        the stack the operation is known as the pop operation. If we try to pop from 
        an empty stack then it is known as underflow and if we try to push an element 
        in a stack that is already full, then it is known as overflow.

        Mainly the following four basic operations are performed in the stack:
                
        Push: Adds an item to the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an 
        Overflow condition.</pre>

                20 pushed into stack
                30 pushed into stack
                30 Popped from stack
                Top element is : 20
                Elements present in stack : 20 10

                        Time complexity of heapify is O(Logn).
                        Time complexity of createAndBuildHeap() is O(n)
                        And, hence the overall time complexity of Heap Sort is O(nLogn).
